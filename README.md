Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random Forests Regression.

Machine Learning Regression models:
Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

Machine Learning Classification models:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Kernel SVM
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree Classification
Random Forest Classification
